## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once the plugin is installed, you can begin using it. For a better user experience, 'Pin' the extension to your toolbar so it's always available.

To use the plugin, the following is required:

-   You must be logged into a Salesforce Org in your current tab.
-   Your user must have the ability to 'Login As' another user.
    -   User needs the 'Modify All Data' permission.

Click the '+' button at the very top and start searching for the users you would like to save for quick access. It's important to select only valid usernames. This means you can't simply save a value like "abc" as a **username**. Begin typing into the input, and if a valid user is found, you can select them from the list.
The **Label** input is not required.
